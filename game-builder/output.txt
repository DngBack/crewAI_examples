What is the game you would like to build? What will be the mechanics?
I would like to build a Tic Tac Toe game. The mechanics are straightforward: it's a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a cell in the grid with their respective symbol, either 'X' or 'O'. The objective is to be the first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all nine cells are filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw. The simplicity of the rules makes it easy to learn and quick to play, yet it still offers strategic depth.

Using the code you got, check for errors. Check for logic errors,
syntax errors, missing imports, variable declarations, mismatched brackets,
and security vulnerabilities.

Players take turns marking a cell in the grid with their respective symbol, either 'X' or 'O'. The objective is to be the first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends in a draw if all nine cells are filled without any player achieving three in a row. The provided code includes a class `TicTacToe` with methods for initializing the game, printing the board, checking for a winner, checking if the board is full, and playing the game. The play function allows players to input their moves and checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
